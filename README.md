# Challenge-linear_regression_demo

This is the weekly challenge code solution for [this](https://youtu.be/vOppzHpvTiQ) video by Siraj Raval on Youtube. Here I attempt to design a linear model for the dataset challenge_dataset.py to generate a linear model for predicting the weight of an animal based on it's brain weight. For the first 3 values as test data the model has acheived a mean squared error of 99.21 and respective errors -17.59, -8.19 and -10.03.

The ouptut plot is shown below.
